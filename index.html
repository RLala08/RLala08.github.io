            <h1 class="headers" id="about-me">About Me</h1>
            <p>I have always been passionate about the design of computer systems and the deep integration of software and hardware 
                that powers our world. It has always fascinated me how the physical and procedural design of components can crucially 
                change how they perform and what applications they can be used for. For this reason, I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree 
                in Computer Engineering and plan to pursue a master’s as well with a concentration in hardware. I also enjoy programming, 
                particularly, building software with a team that’s greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

                <p>August 2022 - Present</p>
                <p>As a teaching assistant for ENGR131, I aid in teaching students the fundamentals of engineering. I
                     answer questions and guide students to learn STEM concepts, professional communication, and 
                     effective teaming. Additionally, I collaborate with peer teachers and instructors to improve the 
                     learning outcomes of class time and assignments. I also evaluate assignments and quizzes on 
                     engineering applications and technologies.</p>

                <p>In this position, I undertook multiple roles around a retail store. This multi-faceted responsibility required me 
                    to learn quickly and be a flexible and multi-tasking team member. I was tasked with being knowledgeable in all 
                    areas and was often required to train new hires while helping customers. This position grew my verbal communication, 
                    teaming, and leadership skills.</p>

                    on integrating the necessary sensors and electrical parts with a functional mechanical design 
                    for the prosthetic. My personal contributions include researching and developing microcontroller 
                    design using Tinkercad and collaborating on servomechanism code using the Servo C++ library. 
                    Through this experience, I have gained knowledge of the iterative design process, Arduino 
                    microcontrollers, prototyping, sub-teaming structures, and inter-team collaboration.</p>

                     regression techniques to plot comparison graphs of the different enzymes. We delivered a final 
                     technical report outlining the program's creation and the results it produced.</p>

                <p>This was my team's final project for the class Introduction to Engineering in Practice. The

                    Purdue University. We designed a solution to make Purdue's Fix-It form system more efficient. We delivered 
                    multiple technical briefs outlining our solution along with two professional presentations to a panel of 
                    graduate students and professors. We gained real-world experience of the Engineering Design Process as well

                <p>For our final project in our First-Year Engineering class, our team was tasked with designing a solution to 
                    improve the recovery of Kimberly-Clark paper towels. Our solution had to be able to separate paper towels from 
                    other trash for compost purposes. We followed the steps of the Engineering Design Process in order to generate 
                    our solutions and write multiple technical briefs documenting the process. The steps we took to create our 
                    final solution included problem scoping, idea generation, computer-aided & physical prototyping, testing, 
                    feedback iteration, and decision making. We then created a final technical report and presentation summarizing
