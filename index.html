        <!--About Me-->
        <section>
            <h1 class="headers" id="about-me">About Me</h1>
            <p>I have always been passionate about the design of computer systems and the deep integration of software and hardware 
                that powers our world. It has always fascinated me how the physical and procedural design of components can crucially 
                change how they perform and what applications they can be used for. For this reason, I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree 
                in Computer Engineering and plan to pursue a master’s as well with a concentration in hardware. I also enjoy programming, 
                particularly, building software with a team that’s greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

                <p>January 2022 – Present</p>
                <p>As a member of ASME Prosthetics, I am aiding in the design of a prosthetic hand for a 
                    professional chef who lost his fingers. On the Software Sub-Team, we have been focusing 
                    on integrating the necessary sensors and electrical parts with a functional mechanical design 
                    for the prosthetic. My personal contributions include researching and developing microcontroller 
                    design using Tinkercad and collaborating on servomechanism code using the Servo C++ library. 
                    Through this experience, I have gained knowledge of the iterative design process, Arduino 
                    microcontrollers, prototyping, sub-teaming structures, and inter-team collaboration.</p>

                <p>On the IndyGo Project team of the Power Engineering Society, we worked with IndyGo to create 
                    an algorithm to measure the battery degradation of their electric buses. My personal contributions 
                    included writing individual Python functions to be used in the final program along with outlining,
                     summarizing, and compiling research on lithium-ion battery degradation. I gained experience in 
                     presenting and explaining my work to the rest of the team.</p>

                <p>As our final project in First-Year Engineering, my team and I developed a MATLAB program to analyze
                     enzyme test data from a detergent manufacturing company. In order to conclude which enzymes would 
                     work best, we supplied a program that users could plug a data file into that would use non-linear 
                     regression techniques to plot comparison graphs of the different enzymes. We delivered a final 
                     technical report outlining the program's creation and the results it produced.</p>

                <p>This was my team's final project for the class Introduction to Engineering in Practice. The 
                    assignment was to use the Engineering Design Process to create a solution to a problem prevalent at 
                    Purdue University. We designed a solution to make Purdue's Fix-It form system more efficient. We delivered 
                    multiple technical briefs outlining our solution along with two professional presentations to a panel of 
                    graduate students and professors. We gained real-world experience of the Engineering Design Process as well 
                    as creating professional deliverables for clients.</p>

                <p>For our final project in our First-Year Engineering class, our team was tasked with designing a solution to 
                    improve the recovery of Kimberly-Clark paper towels. Our solution had to be able to separate paper towels from 
                    other trash for compost purposes. We followed the steps of the Engineering Design Process in order to generate 
                    our solutions and write multiple technical briefs documenting the process. The steps we took to create our 
                    final solution included problem scoping, idea generation, computer-aided & physical prototyping, testing, 
                    feedback iteration, and decision making. We then created a final technical report and presentation summarizing 
                    the project.</p>
